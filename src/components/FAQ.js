    { question: "How does your AI-powered font identifier work?", answer: "Our model analyzes raster font images and predicts the closest vector fonts based on learned feature mappings." },
    { question: "What makes your font detection model unique?", answer: "Unlike traditional tools, our model uses deep learning to match raster fonts with vector fonts, providing high-accuracy results." },
    { question: "What types of font images does your model support?", answer: "Our model supports single-character and multi-character raster text images in fonts like Arial, Calibri, and Times New Roman." },
    { question: "How can I improve the accuracy of font identification?", answer: "Upload high-resolution, clear, and properly cropped text images with minimal noise for better predictions." },
    { question: "Does the model work on handwritten or cursive fonts?", answer: "Currently, our model focuses on printed raster fonts, but future updates may include support for handwritten and cursive fonts." },
    { question: "Is the font identification tool free to use?", answer: "Yes, you can use the basic font detection for free, while advanced features may be available in a premium version." },
